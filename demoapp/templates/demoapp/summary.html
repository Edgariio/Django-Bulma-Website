                This front-end framework was first released in 2016. This means that the community for this framework is still new and relatively small. Despite this Bulma has
                gained enough popularity to compete with other front-end frameworks like Bootstrap.

                The most obvious strength of Bulma is to provide an easy method of styling a modern webpage using colmuns, container, etc. It provides numerous fonts, navigation,
                column and sizing options with many elements and components. The main weakness of Bulma is the fact it is a relatively new framework when compared to other frameworks
                like Bootstrap, which has more elements in its library overall and more options for styling and implementation than Bulma. Despite this, as Bulma continues to make often
                updates, this weakness can be offset significantly.

                Django is a high-level Python beck-end framework. It is currently the most popular back-end web development framework used with Python. The Django community 
                is also very large, which means there are a lot of packages available for use to make it easier for developers to create their webpages.

                Main strength of Django is the large amount of options it provides for the developer due to the amount of packages available from the community. This makes it
                one of the most versatile Python back-end development frameworks available. Another strength is that Drjango has a lot of good documentation available online, which
                makes it easy for developers to access any information they may need about the framework. The main weakness of Django is when its used for small projects because there is 
                a considerable amount of setup necessary just to get started, which can be tedious for developers making many small projects using Django.
